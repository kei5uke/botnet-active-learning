# botnet_active_learning
This repository contains code used for experiments in my BSc final thesis, “Multi-class Classification of Botnet Detection by Active Learning.”   

## Thesis in Nutshell 
The process of labeling malware samples and network traffic is a costly endeavor in the cybersecurity industry.  
This active learning framework enables the efficient creation of effective ML models using a limited amount of data.  
This thesis focuses on benchmarking well-known query strategies to determine which strategy and parameters can achieve the best results with the fewest data samples.

### Conclusion
- Margin Sampling is the optimal strategy in terms of stability and convergence speed.
- If multiple instances are required in each iteration, Ranked Batch-mode Sampling with a small unlabeled pool may perform well.

## Setup Instruction (For those who want to run the code)
### Environment
To get started, clone the repository:
``` 
git clone https://github.com/kei5uke/botnet-active-learning.git
```
Then, change your current directory and install the dependencies:  
```
cd active_learning
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Next, install the MedBIoT and N-BaIoT datasets and store them in the ```/dataset``` directory   
The file structure is shown in the directory, so be sure to install the datasets accordingly     
You can find the datasets here:   
- [MedBIoT Dataset](https://cs.taltech.ee/research/data/medbiot/)  
- [N-BaIoT Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/442/detection+of+iot+botnet+attacks+n+baiot)  

### Dataset Pickels
Only a small portion of the datasets is used for the experiments  
To generate dataset pickles, run ```python3 Make_df_MedBIoT.py``` and ```python3 Make_df_N-BaIoT.py```  

### Experiment
Change common variables in ```global_variable.py``` and shared variables in each file  
Now you are ready to run any experimental code in ```/active_learning``` directory
